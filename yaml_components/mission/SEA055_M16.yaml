  comment: Altitude set to 5m for most of the mission but occasionally increased especially
    at the start of the mission. Zt/zs was set to 10m for the entire mission duration.
    The glider struggled detecting the seabed so zb was often reduced and/or a high
    altitude value was used. Drift mode with payload switched off was enabled 3 times
    during this mission so three data gaps occured
