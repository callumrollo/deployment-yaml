  comment: Glider flew with zt/zs=2 and alt=2 for full mission duration. Vertical
    speed was increased towards the end of the mission to reach recovery waypoint
    in time.  Tridente phycocyanin channel values are suspect. The cause is under
    investigation and appears to be due to bad calibration https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/static/img/reports/Quality_Issue_5_tridente_phycocyanin.pdf
