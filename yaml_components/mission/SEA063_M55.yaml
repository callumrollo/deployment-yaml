  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. Due to iridium communication issues, the glider spend
    about 17h at surface drifting and after that the glider was recovered

  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Dissolved oxygen concentration values may be inaccurate. Deterioration
      of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors and non-linear temporal drift in
      other missions with this sensor during this timeframe. We have not observed
      issues in this particular mission, but we recommend caution when using this
      data. More information on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
