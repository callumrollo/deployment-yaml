  comment: Altitude set to 6m for the entire mission duration . Zt/zs set to 5m for
    the start of the mission and it was then decreased to 2m for the rest of them
    mission. Glider often turned back well before 6m from the seabed due to false
    triggering of the Altitude. The glider was set to drift at depth and sit on the
    seabed with payload switched off to save battery for the last 2 weeks of the mission.
