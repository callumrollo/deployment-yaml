  comment: Altitude set to 10m for most of the mission and occasionally increased
    to 12m. Zt/zs set to 25m at the beginning of the mission and then increased to
    30m. Soon after the start of them mission, the oxygen sensor acquisition settings
    were changed to record data every 30s instead of 1s between 0 and 1m (i.e while
    at surface)
