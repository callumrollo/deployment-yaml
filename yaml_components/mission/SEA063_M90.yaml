  comment: The mission is part of the inTail project with testing the new oxygen sensor.
    zt/zs=2 and alt=4-8 for full mission duration for the sake of the InTail sensor.
    During this mission the glider is flown over a bottom mounted ADCP for intercomparison
    to the onboard AD2CP. Faster vertical speeds and steeper pitches are used for
    these tests. Oxygen concentration is showing unrealistically high values around
    80 m. See qc. Sub sampling towards the end of the mission as well as a period
    with payload off to save battery to account for logistics. Tridente phycocyanin
    channel values are suspect. The cause is under investigation and appears to be
    due to bad calibration https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/static/img/reports/Quality_Issue_5_tridente_phycocyanin.pdf
