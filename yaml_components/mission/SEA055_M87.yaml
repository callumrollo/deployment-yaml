  comment: Part of the TurboMix mission, deployed with Legato Tridente and a MicroRider-1000-G
    sensor. MR1000G was set to sample every 2nd dive downcast + up to 40 m upcast,
    although it sampled below 40 m every dive. Glider did afternoon/night lotiering
    for an extended time to extend battery to fit with operations logistics. Glider
    did not collect data from the 2025-02-15 to save battery.
