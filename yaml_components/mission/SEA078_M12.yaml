  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration . Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. Glider hit the seabed at C291 as the ADCP failed
    to detect the seabed. The glider was moved far north from the original transect
    for recovery

    comment: The absolute values of the oxygen data can be unreliable. The relative
      variability is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift exist has been observed.
      Absolute values may be inaccurate and lower than reference data. Re-calibration
      of the sensor is required. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
