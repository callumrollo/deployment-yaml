  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused errors in the dissolved oxygen concentration.
      Values are observed to be substantially higher than the reference CTD cast at
      deployment. There is an apparent temporal increase in dissolved oxygen concentration
      throughout the mission. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
