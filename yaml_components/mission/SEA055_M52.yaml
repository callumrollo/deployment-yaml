  comment: Altitude set to 5m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the most of the mission and occasionally increased to 15m when the glider struggled
    with currents. At C727 the sampling frequency of the oxygen sensor (JFE AROD-FT)
    was increased from 30s to 1s for the data collected in the top 2m of the water

    comment: Dissolved oxygen concentration values may be inaccurate. Deterioration
      of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors and non-linear temporal drift in
      other missions with this sensor during this timeframe. We have not observed
      issues in this particular mission, but we recommend caution when using this
      data. More information on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
