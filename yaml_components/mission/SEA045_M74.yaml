  comment: Altitude set to 5m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. The acquisition settings for the oxygen sensor (JFE
    AROD-FT) were changed towards the end of the mission. Instead of fast sampling
    all the time, while at surface, the sensor was set to sample  every 30s. Glider
    was set to drift for the last part of the mission with payload switched off. No
    science data is available for that period

    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors in the dissolved
      oxygen concentration. Values are observed to be substantially lower than the
      reference CTD cast at deployment.  There is an apparent non-linear temporal
      increase in dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the mission. More information
      on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
