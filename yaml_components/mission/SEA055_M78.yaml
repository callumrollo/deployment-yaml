  comment: Part of PhycoGlider mission, deployed with Legato Tridente sensor. Performed
    virtual mooring at BY38 during the 18/7-24 for calibration with R/V Svea. In connection
    to that bottom tracking failed during dives 612 and 613 and following two dives
    went to 100 m. Apart from that zt/zs=2 and alt=2 for full mission duration.
