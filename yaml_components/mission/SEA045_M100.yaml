  comment: Part of the PhycoGlider II project. The glider timed a calibration profile
    at station BY38 with R/V SVEA on 2025-08-13 during SMHIs August expedition. Glider
    was emergency recovered due to an issue with the linear motor movement. Pressure
    is sourced from the ADCP due to issues with the Legato pressure sensor Tridente
    phycocyanin channel values are suspect. The cause is under investigation and appears
    to be due to bad calibration https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/static/img/reports/Quality_Issue_5_tridente_phycocyanin.pdf
