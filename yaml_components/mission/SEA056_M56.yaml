  comment: Max diving depth set to 57m to avoid sampling in anoxic waters as it damages
    the methane sensor. Zt/zs set to 2m for the entire mission duration and altitude
    set to 5m but the glider was flying well above the seabed due to the shallow max
    diving depth (zb). Methane sensor equilibration tests were performed so the glider
    was set to drift for 1h every 10m from surface to bottom depth

    comment: Dissolved oxygen concentration values may be inaccurate. Deterioration
      of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors and non-linear temporal drift in
      other missions with this sensor during this timeframe. We have not observed
      issues in this particular mission, but we recommend caution when using this
      data. More information on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
