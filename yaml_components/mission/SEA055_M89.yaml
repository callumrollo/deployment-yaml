  comment: Part of the TurboMix mission, deployed with Legato Tridente and a MicroRider-1000-G
    sensor. MR1000G was set to sample every 2nd dive downcast + up to 40 m upcast,
    although it sampled at all times due to a conflict in the softwares of the glider
    payload and MicroRider sensor which lead to an increased battery consumption.
    Part-time loitering was performed during the last part of the mission to save
    battery.
