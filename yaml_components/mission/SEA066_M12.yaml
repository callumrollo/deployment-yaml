  comment: Altitude set to 6m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 5m for
    the start of the mission and it was then decreased to 2m for the rest of them
    mission. The glider was set to drift at depth with payload switched off to save
    battery for the last few days of the mission. No data is available for this period

  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused errors in the dissolved oxygen concentration.
      Values are observed to be substantially higher than the reference CTD cast at
      deployment. There is an apparent temporal increase in dissolved oxygen concentration
      throughout the mission. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
