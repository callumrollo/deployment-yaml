    comment: "Following issues with the oxygen sensor, a 2-point calibration has been\
      \ performed on date {2023-05-25}. The values at 0 and 100 % saturation are accurate.\
      \ Absolute Values between these two extremes may be inaccurate. The relative\
      \ variability is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift occurs. During\
      \ tests values that can be outside the manufacturer acceptance range have been\
      \ observed when compared to the output from a reference sensor. This issue is\
      \ particularly evident around 100\u03BCmol/l. More information on the history\
      \ and updates regarding this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates)."
