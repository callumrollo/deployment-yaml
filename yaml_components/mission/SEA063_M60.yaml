  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration . Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. Emergency recovery due to a broken linear actuator.
    The glider spent about 20h at surface while waiting for recovery. During most
    of this time, the payload was swithced off and no data was collected

    comment: The absolute values of the oxygen data can be unreliable. The relative
      variability is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift exist has been observed.
      Absolute values may be inaccurate and lower than reference data. Re-calibration
      of the sensor is required. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
