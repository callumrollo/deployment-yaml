  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration apart from occasional
    higher values in the deep section of the transect. Zt/zs set to 2m for the entire
    mission duration. Glider hit the seabed multiple dives as the ADCP failed to detect
    the seabed. The bottom depth (zb) was reduced occasionally to prevent the glider
    from hitting the seabed
