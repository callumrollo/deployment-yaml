  comment: The last few days of mission glider loitered for a couple of cycles and
    flew a few cycles with payload disabled to save battery. After a couple of instances
    of hitting the seabed due to failed bottom tracking glider flew only to a limited
    depth at the end of mission. Apart from that the glider flew on alt=2 and zb/zs=2
    for the full mission duration.
