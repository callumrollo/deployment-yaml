  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration . Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. The glider was put on drift mode towards the end
    of the mission with payload switched off causing gaps in the dataset. The glider
    collected data at least once a day in between drifting dives

    comment: Following issues with the oxygen sensor, a 2-point calibration has been
      performed on date {2023-06-15}. The values at 0 and 100 % saturation are accurate.
      Absolute Values between these two extremes may be inaccurate. The relative variability
      is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift occurs. During tests values that
      can be outside the manufacturer acceptance range have been observed when compared
      to the output from a reference sensor. This issue is particularly evident around
      100μmol/l. More information on the history and updates regarding this issue
      (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
