  comment: Altitude set to 5m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 4m for
    the entire mission duration. The glider hit the seabed a few times due to issues
    with the ADCP. Occasionally max diving depth was reduced or altitude was increased
    to avoid the risk of collision

  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused errors in the dissolved oxygen concentration.
      Values are observed to be substantially higher than the reference CTD cast at
      deployment. There is an apparent temporal increase in dissolved oxygen concentration
      throughout the mission. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
