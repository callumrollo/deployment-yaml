  comment: Altitude set to 6m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 5m for
    the entire mission duration. The gldier hit the seabed a few times due to ADCP
    failure. ADCP and irradiance sensor (OCR504) stopped recording dat at C174. Emergency
    recovery due to water leaks in the dry section of the glider. The raw data could
    not be recovered and only the subsampled files sent through iriudium are available
    for this mission
