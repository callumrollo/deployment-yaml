  comment: Part of the PhycoGlider II project. The glider timed a calibration profile
    at station BY38 with R/V SVEA 23:00 UTC on 2025-07-18 during SMHIs July expedition.
    Vertical speed was increased shortly before the calibration to make it to BY38
    in time.  Tridente phycocyanin channel values are suspect. The cause is under
    investigation and appears to be due to bad calibration https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/static/img/reports/Quality_Issue_5_tridente_phycocyanin.pdf
