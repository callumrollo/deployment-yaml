  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration apart from occasional
    higher values in the deep section of the transect. Zt/zs set to 2m for the entire
    mission duration. The optical sensor (FLBBCD) stopped recording data at C85. The
    ADCP stopped recording data at C146 and glider hit the seabed. Glider recover
    right after the issues with the ADCP. After recovery, water was found in the payload
    bay which caused the issues with the FLBBCD and ADCP

    comment: "Following issues with the oxygen sensor, a 2-point calibration has been\
      \ performed on date {2023-09-04}. The values at 0 and 100 % saturation are accurate.\
      \ Absolute Values between these two extremes may be inaccurate. The relative\
      \ variability is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift occurs. During\
      \ tests values that can be outside the manufacturer acceptance range have been\
      \ observed when compared to the output from a reference sensor. This issue is\
      \ particularly evident around 100\u03BCmol/l. More information on the history\
      \ and updates regarding this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates)."
