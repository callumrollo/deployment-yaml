  comment: Altitude set to 12m the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for most
    of the mission and occasioanally increased to 15m. The ADCP stopped working at
    C142 as well as the OCR504 (Irradiance). Glider was recovered soon after due to
    suspected leak. Water was found in the dry section of the glider

    comment: Dissolved oxygen concentration values may be inaccurate. Deterioration
      of the foil has caused errors and temporal drift in other missions with this
      sensor during this timeframe. We have not observed issues in this particular
      mission, but we recommend caution when using this data. More information on
      the history and updates regarding this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
