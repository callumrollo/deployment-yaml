  comment: Bottom tracking failed occasionally leading the glider diving on a safe,
    consitent zb for a part of the mission. alt=2 and zt/zs=2 for the full mission
    duration. Finished the mission with faster flight for logistics and tests connected
    to the Tridente sensor.  Tridente phycocyanin channel values are suspect. The
    cause is under investigation and appears to be due to bad calibration https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/static/img/reports/Quality_Issue_5_tridente_phycocyanin.pdf
