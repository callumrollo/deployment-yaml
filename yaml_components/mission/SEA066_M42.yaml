  comment: Altitude set to 5m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. Glider was set to drift for the last part of the
    mission with payload switched off. In this period, the glider was completing some
    normal dives with payload switched on. This is why there are gaps in the dataset

    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused errors in the dissolved oxygen concentration.
      Values are observed to be substantially higher than the reference CTD cast at
      deployment. There is an apparent temporal increase in dissolved oxygen concentration
      throughout the mission. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
