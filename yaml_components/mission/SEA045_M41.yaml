  comment: Altitude set to 12m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 25m for
    the first third of the mission and then 30m for the rest. At cycle 245 the acquiisition
    settings of the CTD (RBR LEGATO) were changed. The sensor sampling frequency was
    changed from 1Hz to the fastest possible
