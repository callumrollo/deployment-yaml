  comment: After a few days the max diving  depth set to 60m to avoid sampling in
    anoxic waters as it damages the methane sensor. Zt/zs set to 4m for the entire
    mission duration and altitude set to 5m but the glider was flying well above the
    seabed due to the shallow max diving depth (zb)
