  comment: Altitude set to 5m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 2m for
    the entire mission duration. Glider was lost in an underwater cave and recovered
    a month later. This is why there is a large gap in the dataset in this area

    comment: "Dissolved oxygen concentration values are inaccurate. Deterioration\
      \ of the foil has caused errors and temporal drift in other missions with this\
      \ sensor during this timeframe. We do not observe a temporal drift in this particular\
      \ mission, but the sensor does observe the expected 0 \u03BCmol L<sup>-1</sup>\
      \ oxygen concentration in anoxic waters. More information on the history and\
      \ updates regarding this issue (https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates)."
