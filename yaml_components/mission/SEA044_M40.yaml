  comment: Altitude set to 6m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs set to 5m for
    the entire mission duration. Glider hit the seabed multiple times due to issues
    with the altimeter and after that the maximum diving depth was reduced to avoid
    possible collisions with the seabed. The glider maximum diving depth was set to
    65 or 75m depending on the section of the transect, therefore the glider often
    turned back well before 6m from the seabed
