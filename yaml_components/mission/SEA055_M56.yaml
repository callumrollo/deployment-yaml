  comment: Altitude set to 2m for most of the mission and occasionally increased to
    3 and 5m. Zt/zs set to 2m for the entire mission duration and briefly increased
    to 20m towards the end of the mission

  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors in the dissolved
      oxygen concentration. Values are observed to be substantially lower than the
      reference CTD cast at deployment.  There is an apparent non-linear temporal
      increase in dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the mission. More information
      on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
