  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Deterioration of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors in the dissolved
      oxygen concentration. Values are observed to be substantially lower than the
      reference CTD cast at deployment.  There is an apparent non-linear temporal
      increase in dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the mission. More information
      on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
