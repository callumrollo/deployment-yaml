  oxygen_concentration:
    comment: Dissolved oxygen concentration values may be inaccurate. Deterioration
      of the foil has caused uncorrectable errors and non-linear temporal drift in
      other missions with this sensor during this timeframe. We have not observed
      issues in this particular mission, but we recommend caution when using this
      data. More information on the history and updates regarding this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
