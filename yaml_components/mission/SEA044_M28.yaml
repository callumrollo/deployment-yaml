  comment: Altitude set to 30m for the entire mission duration. Zt/zs mostly set to
    25m and occasionally at 30 and 35m. Irradiance acqusition settings set to collect
    data only from 0 to 100m and for the last week of this mission the settinsg were
    changed to collected data all the way to 150m
