  comment: Altitude set to 5m and soon after the start of the mission, it was increased
    to 6m. Zt/zs set to 10m and soon after the start of the mission, it was decreased
    to 5m. Glider hit the seabed at C181. At C253 the sampling frequency of the oxygen
    sensor (JFE AROD-FT) was increased from 30s to 1s

    comment: An issue with the sensor causes a temporal drift in the oxygen values.
      Restarting the sensor every surfacing seems to solve the issue. Data from 2021-05-15
      onwards is bad as the sensor is not set to restart every surfacing anymore.
