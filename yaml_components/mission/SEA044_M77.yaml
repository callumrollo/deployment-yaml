  comment: Altitude set to 2m for the entire mission duration . Zt/zs set to 2m for
    most of the mission but occasionally increased to 10-15-20m when the glider struggled
    with strong currents

    comment: The absolute values of the oxygen data can be unreliable. The relative
      variability is confirmed to be valid and no temporal drift exist has been observed.
      Absolute values may be inaccurate and lower than reference data. Re-calibration
      of the sensor is required. More information on the history and updates regarding
      this issue ( https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/data/updates).
